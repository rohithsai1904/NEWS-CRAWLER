CARMAKERS THAT SAW NEARLY A DECADE OF INDIAN SALES GROWTH WIPED OUT IN 2020 ARE EXPECTING A BOUNCE BACK IN DEMAND THIS YEAR. BUT IT IS LIKELY TO BE LED BY SMALL, AFFORDABLE CARS - A SECTOR DOMINATED BY HOMEGROWN LEADER AND RIVAL HYUNDAI - RATHER THAN THE PREMIUM MODELS CHURNED OUT BY MOST FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS, INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES AND ANALYSTS SAY. WITH THEIR INDIAN FACTORIES RUNNING WELL BELOW CAPACITY AND SALES FAR BEHIND ORIGINAL HOPES, FIRMS LIKE FORD, HONDA , NISSAN, AND VOLKSWAGEN FACE DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT FUTURE INVESTMENTS. \"IT IS A SURVIVAL ISSUE,\" SAID ONE SENIOR EXECUTIVE WITH A WESTERN AUTOMAKER WHO DECLINED TO BE NAMED. \"CHOOSING TO REMAIN IN INDIA DEPENDS ON THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS,\" THE EXECUTIVE ADDED, FORECASTING THAT, IF THE OUTLOOK REMAINS GRIM, THE NUMBER OF AUTOMAKERS IN THE COUNTRY COULD FALL. INDIA HAS ALREADY SEEN GENERAL MOTORS AND HARLEY-DAVIDSON SHUT UP SHOP LAST YEAR. ANURAG MEHROTRA, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT FORD INDIA, TOLD REUTERS THE CAR MARKET HAD NOT GROWN AS PROJECTED AND COVID HAD MADE MATTERS WORSE, HURTING DOMESTIC SALES AND EXPORTS. \"THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE LONG-TERM GROWTH PROSPECTS OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND ECONOMY HAVE RESULTED IN SERIOUS CHALLENGES, INCLUDING CAPACITY UTILISATION,\" MEHROTRA SAID. HE SAID THE PANDEMIC DEMANDED \"AGILE SOLUTIONS AND TOUGH DECISIONS,\" BUT DID NOT GIVE DETAILS OF FORD'S PLANS. THE US AUTOMAKER HAS SAID PREVIOUSLY IT IS WORKING ON A NEW PLAN FOR INDIA. VOLKSWAGEN, WHICH REVISED ITS INDIA STRATEGY IN 2018 PUTTING ITS SISTER COMPANY SKODA IN CHARGE, REITERATED ITS PLAN TO INVEST $1.2 BILLION TO CORNER 5% OF THE MARKET BY 2025 WITH NEW LAUNCHES, STARTING WITH TWO SUVS THIS YEAR. THE AMBITION IS TO CONTINUE BUILDING AND REINFORCING THE GROUP'S POSITION IN THE INDIAN MARKET, A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE LOCAL UNIT, SKODA AUTO VOLKSWAGEN INDIA, SAID. HONDA AND NISSAN DID NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS SEEKING COMMENT. A DECADE AGO, INDIA WAS WIDELY TIPPED TO BE THE WORLD'S THIRD-LARGEST CAR MARKET BY 2020, LAGGING ONLY THE UNITED STATES AND INDUSTRY LEADER CHINA, AS CAR OWNERSHIP PER CAPITA AMONG ITS 1.3 BILLION PEOPLE CAUGHT UP WITH MORE MATURE MARKETS. INSTEAD, YEARS OF HIGH TAXES ON LARGE CARS AND SUVS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT FOREIGN AUTOMAKERS, AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN 2019 AND THE PANDEMIC HAVE HELD IT BACK AT NO. 5. THE PURCHASING POWER OF INDIAN CONSUMERS REMAINS FAR BELOW THOSE IN THE WEST, WITH THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF A CAR JUST $10,000 COMPARED WITH $38,000 IN THE UNITED STATES, ACCORDING TO AT CONSULTANCY JATO DYNAMICS. THE LONG-TERM POTENTIAL REMAINS, ANALYSTS SAY, WITH INDIA HOME TO ONLY AROUND 27 CARS PER 1,000 PEOPLE. CONSULTANT LMC AUTOMOTIVE EXPECTS INDIAN CAR SALES TO SURGE 35% THIS YEAR TO 3.17 MILLION FROM ALMOST A DECADE-LOW OF 2.35 MILLION IN 2020. BUT THAT WOULD STILL BE A FRACTION OF THE TOP MARKETS. LMC SEES SALES IN CHINA RISING 7% TO 22 MILLION VEHICLES THIS YEAR, AND CLIMBING 21% IN THE UNITED STATES TO 13.5 MILLION. WHILE BOTH CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE PUTTING THE PANDEMIC BEHIND THEM, INDIA IS STILL RECOVERING FROM A DEADLY SECOND WAVE AND HAS FULLY VACCINATED ONLY ABOUT 5% OF ADULTS. THE EXTRA PRESSURE ON PUBLIC FINANCES HAS ALSO LEFT INDIA AT RISK OF LOSING ITS INVESTMENT CREDIT RATING, LIMITING ITS SCOPE FOR THE SORT OF ADDITIONAL STIMULUS MEASURES THAT HAVE HELPED TO BOOST US AND CHINESE AUTO MARKETS. IT IS A GRIM PROSPECT FOR FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE HAVING TO INVEST IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES IN MORE MATURE, PROFITABLE MARKETS. ACCORDING TO THE SOCIETY OF INDIAN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS (SIAM), FORD, HONDA, SKODA AND VOLKSWAGEN SAW SALES IN INDIA DROP 20%-28% LAST FISCAL YEAR THROUGH MARCH 31, MORE THAN TWICE THE DECLINE AT MARUTI SUZUKI AND HYUNDAI. UTILISATION LEVELS HAVE FALLEN BELOW 30% AT SOME FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS' FACTORIES, DATA FROM SIAM SHOWED. THAT IS A FAR CRY FROM THEIR INITIAL GOALS. NISSAN HAD HOPED FOR 5% SHARE OF INDIA'S CAR MARKET BY 2020 BUT HAS LESS THAN 1% TODAY. HONDA TOLD REUTERS IN 2018 THAT TO BE A \"MEANINGFUL PLAYER\" IT NEEDED 10% MARKET SHARE. ITS SHARE HAS FALLEN TO 3% FROM 5% BACK THEN, AND IT HAS CLOSED ONE OF TWO PLANTS IN THE COUNTRY. AND FORD, WHICH HAS INVESTED OVER $2 BILLION IN INDIA, HAS LESS THAN A 2% SHARE. TO COMPETE IN INDIA COMPANIES NEED A STEADY STREAM OF NEW PRODUCTS, WHICH NEEDS MORE INVESTMENT, SAID LMC'S AMMAR MASTER. \"AUTOMAKERS WITH AN AGED PRODUCT RANGE FACE AN UPHILL BATTLE AND ARE AT A GREATER RISK OF LOSING SALES AND MARKET SHARE,\" HE SAID, ADDING COMPANIES LIKE FORD, NISSAN AND HONDA DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE STRONG PRODUCT PIPELINES. A LACK OF CLARITY ON EXPORT POLICIES AND OTHER REGULATORY HURDLES ARE COMPLICATING MATTERS FOR GLOBAL CARMAKERS, EXECUTIVES AT TWO OF THEM SAID. INDIA LAST YEAR WITHDREW ITS EXPORT INCENTIVE SCHEME - CRUCIAL FOR COMPANIES LIKE FORD AND VOLKSWAGEN THAT SHIP OUT MORE CARS THAN THEY SELL LOCALLY - AND IS YET TO FINALISE A NEW ONE. THE ABSENCE OF FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN INDIA AND EXPORT NATIONS IS ALSO PUTTING IT AT A COST DISADVANTAGE COMPARED WITH PLACES LIKE THAILAND AND VIETNAM THAT HAVE SUCH DEALS, THE EXECUTIVES ADDED. \"INDIA NEEDS TO OFFSET ITS ASSOCIATED RISKS THAT HOLD BACK MULTINATIONAL AUTOMAKERS FROM SCALING UP OR INVESTING FURTHER,\" SAID FORMER FORD INDIA EXECUTIVE VINAY PIPARSANIA.", "imglink": ["https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-83624829,imgsize-1088668,width-400,resizemode-4/83624829.jpg"], "imgcaption": [""], "tag": ["Corona News"]}

WILL SHE ABLE TO RESTORE BALANCE IN THIS TUSSLE BETWEEN MAN VERSUS WILD?  VIDYA VINCENT (VIDYA BALAN), A COMMITTED FOREST OFFICER, HASN\u2019T GOT A PROMOTION IN NINE YEARS, AND AFTER SIX YEARS OF A DESK PROFILE, HER NEW POSITION IN THE FORESTS OF BIJASPUR COMES WITH ITS SET OF UNIQUE CHALLENGES. OVER A VIDEO CHAT, WHEN SHE CASUALLY HINTS TO HER HUSBAND, PAWAN (MUKUL CHADDHA) THAT SHE FEELS STAGNANT WITH NO GROWTH AND MIGHT RESIGN AFTER SHE SNAGS THAT COVETED PROMOTION, HE EGGS HER TO STAY ON. MOSTLY BECAUSE HE ISN\u2019T SURE HOW LONG HE CAN HOLD ON TO HIS JOB IN MUMBAI.  IN MANY WAYS, VIDYA\u2019S WORLD SEEMS ISOLATED, THE LONE WOMAN IN A MALE DOMINATED DEPARTMENT. YET, HER COLLEAGUES AND PEERS TRYING TO UNDERMINE HER IS THE LEAST OF HER WORRIES. SHE MAY BE A WOMAN OF FEW WORDS BUT IT DOESN\u2019T TAKE AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT SHE IS DETERMINED AND INTENSELY PASSIONATE ABOUT HER WORK. WHEN A TIGRESS, IDENTIFIED AS T12, BY THE FOREST DEPARTMENT, STARTS HUNTING NEAR THE VILLAGE FIELDS, HUMANS AND FARM ANIMALS FALL PREY. FOR THE VILLAGERS, TIGERS PASSING THROUGH THEIR FIELDS IS A NORM, AS THEIR VILLAGE IS FLANKED BY FORESTS ON BOTH SIDES. IN THEIR OWN WORDS, THE TIGERS OFTEN PASS BY WITHOUT EVEN GLANCING IN THEIR DIRECTION, BUT THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT SPREADS THE FEAR OF LIVES AND LIVELIHOOD. ONE THAT IS STOKED BY WARRING LOCAL POLITICIANS AND MADE INTO AN ELECTION DEBATE FOR THE UPCOMING POLLS. FOR VIDYA, LOCATING AND CAPTURING T12 ALIVE IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE BUT THIS MEANS NAVIGATING THROUGH THE SENTIMENTS OF THE LOCALS, THE PRESSURE BUILT BY THE POLITICIANS, HER BOSS BANSAL\u2019S (BRIJENDRA KALRA) ATTITUDE WHO JUST WANTS THE PROBLEM TO DISAPPEAR INTO THE WOODS AND RANJAN RAJHANS (SHARAT SAXENA), AN ALLY OF THE POLITICIANS WHO CALLS HIMSELF A CONSERVATIONIST BUT PRIDES HIMSELF ON THE NUMBER OF TIGERS HE HAS HUNTED. HER ONLY SUPPORT SEEMS TO COMES FROM HASSAN NOORANI (VIJAY RAAZ), WHO IS A ZOOLOGY PROFESSOR IN A NEARBY COLLEGE, SOME OF THE LOCAL VILLAGERS LIKE JYOTI (SAMPA MANDAL), A MEMBER OF THE VILLAGE COMMITTEE AND MR. NANGIA (NEERAJ KABI), THE FOREST DEPARTMENT HEAD.  DIRECTOR AMIT MASURKAR WEAVES AN INTRICATE AND COMPLEX NARRATIVE WITH A RICH VISUAL TEXTURE, AS HE DIVES DEEP INTO THIS MAN VERSUS ANIMAL CONFLICT. THE SCREENPLAY (AASTHA TIKU) IS METICULOUSLY DETAILED, GIVING AN INSIGHT INTO NOT JUST THE PROTAGONIST\u2019S MIND BUT ALSO THE WORKINGS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND ALSO HOW THE VILLAGE AND THE FOREST ARE ENTWINED IN THEIR EXISTENCE.  THE CAMERA (RAKESH HARIDAS, CINEMATOGRAPHY) AND SOUND DESIGN (ANISH JOHN) LITERALLY ROMANCE THE DENSE, GREEN JUNGLES \u2013 DAPPLED SUNSHINE, GURGLING STREAMS, BUZZING OF INSECTS, RUSTLING OF LEAVES, DISTINCT SOUNDS OF BIRDS AND ANIMALS \u2013 IT ALL COMES TO LIFE IN \u2018SHERNI\u2019. ONE SIMPLY CAN\u2019T WALK AWAY WITHOUT FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE FORESTS FIRST. BUT JUST AS ONE IS EASILY MESMERIZED BY THE BEAUTY, ONE OF VIDYA\u2019S AIDES TELL HER \u2014 YOU COULD GO TO THE FOREST 100 TIMES AND PERHAPS SPOT A TIGER ONCE, BUT BE REST ASSURED THAT THE TIGER HAS SPOTTED YOU 99 TIMES. A CHILLING REMINDER OF WHO IS THE INTRUDER AND WHO REIGNS SUPREME IN THE JUNGLES. THE BACKGROUND SCORE (BENEDICT TAYLOR, NAREN CHANDAVARKAR) ADDS TO THE AIR OF MYSTERY AND THE ONLY SONG IN THE FILM (MUSIC BY BANDISH PROJECT, LYRICS BY HUSSAIN HAIDRY) STRIKES THE RIGHT NOTE.  \u201cSHER HAIN TO JUNGLE HAI, JUNGLE HAIN TO BAARISH HAIN, BAARISH HAIN TO PAANI HAIN AUR PAANI HAI TOH HUM HAIN.\u201d, THESE WORDS BY A \u2018FOREST FRIEND\u2019, TRAINED BY HASSAN NOORANI ASSURES VIDYA THAT ALL IS NOT LOST IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTENSE SEARCH FOR THE TIGRESS, WHICH IS LITERALLY A RACE AGAINST TIME AND ADVERSARIES.  VIDYA BALAN GIVES US A REMARKABLE, UNDERSTATED YET POWERFUL PERFORMANCE, AS SHE EXUDES THE QUIET DETERMINATION, PASSION AND GRIT OF HER CHARACTER. DEVOID OF ANY DRAMATIC OVERTONES BUT WITH EYES THAT SPARK ANGER AND SPEAK VOLUMES, IT IS A JOY TO WATCH VIDYA SUBTLY BATTLE SEXISM AND BIAS NOT JUST AT WORK, BUT ALSO AT TIMES AT HOME. VIJAY RAAZ, BRIJENDRA KALA, NEERAJ KABI, SAMPA MANDAL, SHARAT SAXENA ADD WITH THEIR EFFORTLESS PERFORMANCES. SATYAKAM ANAND ALSO LEAVES A MARK.  MASURKAR KEEPS US CAPTIVATED AND HOOKED FOR MOST PART WITH THE PACE ONLY DIPPING IN A FEW POINTS. AS \u2018SHERNI\u2019 TAKES US DEEP INTO THE FORESTS, THROUGH THRILLING, TENSE TIGER TRAILS, IT ALSO GIVES ALSO US A DOSE OF SOME SATIRICAL HUMOUR. ULTIMATELY, MASURKAR\u2019S POTENT FILM ABOUT WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND MAINTAINING THE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE LEAVES YOU WITH A HAUNTING MESSAGE EVEN AS YOU SOAK IN THE SUBLIME BEAUTY OF THE FORESTS. \u2018SHERNI\u2019 MAKES FOR AN INTENSE, INTRIGUING FILM AND IS A MUST-WATCH.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. THE ROAD TO THE HAS BEEN LONG AND TORTUOUS. ORIGINATING AS A GERM OF AN IDEA IN 2009 AND REPEATEDLY GIVEN THE COLD SHOULDER BY BROADCASTERS, THIS ONE-OFF FINAL FOLLOWS TWO COMPLETE CANCELLATIONS AND A CONTROVERSIAL LATE TWEAK IN THE TWO-YEAR POINTS CYCLE. SOMEHOW, THE TWO MOST FITTING CONTENDERS HAVE EMERGED. NEW ZEALAND AND INDIA ARE LIKE CHALK AND CHEESE IN TERMS OF THEIR STYLE OF PLAY, CRICKETING BANK BALANCE AND RESPECTIVE POPULATIONS. WHAT IS COMMON IS THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAVE EMBRACED DISTINCTIVE IDENTITIES TO FORGE WINNING OUTFITS, BOTH UNDER TALISMANIC CAPTAINS WHO SHARE A RARE CAMARADERIE. NEW ZEALAND LOVE TO PLAY THE APPROACHABLE NICE GUYS, PUNCHING ABOVE THEIR WEIGHT WITH DISCIPLINED PERCENTAGE CRICKET. THE INDIANS ARE IN-YOUR-FACE, MORE EXPRESSIVE, PLAYING AN UNAPOLOGETICALLY EXCITING BRAND OF THE GAME. THEIR ELECTRIC, PACE-FUELLED MARCH UP THE TEST RANKS HAS BEEN BRILLIANT TO WATCH.

THE (CBSE) AND THE COUNCIL FOR THE INDIAN SCHOOL CERTIFICATE EXAMINATIONS (CISCE) GAVE DETAILS OF THE EVALUATION POLICY FORMULATED AFTER CONSULTING EXPERTS TO A BENCH OF JUSTICES A M KHANWILKAR AND DINESH MAHESHWARI AND SAID CLASS 12 WOULD BE OUT BEFORE JULY 31. WHILE 14.5 LAKH CLASS 12 STUDENTS APPEAR FOR THE CBSE BOARD, NEARLY 1 LAKH TAKE THE EXAMS CONDUCTED BY CISCE. ATTORNEY GENERAL K K VENUGOPAL, APPEARING FOR THE , AND SOLICITOR GENERAL , APPEARING FOR THE CBSE, TOLD THE COURT THAT THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF EACH STUDENT IN CLASSES 10 (BEST THREE) AND 11 AS WELL AS THE MARKS OR GRADES OBTAINED IN UNIT AND TERM EXAMINATIONS IN CLASS 12 AND PRACTICALS WOULD BE TAKEN IN A GRADED WEIGHTAGE \u2014 30% EACH FOR CLASS 10 AND 11, AND 40% FOR CLASS 12. KEEPING IN MIND THE DISRUPTIONS IN CLASS 12 ASSESSMENTS DUE TO COVID-19, SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN GIVEN LEEWAY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO TAKE ALL ASSESSMENTS (UNIT TESTS, MID-TERMS, PRE-BOARDS) OR JUST THE PRE-BOARDS INTO ACCOUNT OR A COMBINATION. THIS WOULD BE DONE BY A \"RESULTS COMMITTEE\" IN EVERY SCHOOL. SENIOR ADVOCATE JANAKALYAN DAS INFORMED THE BENCH THAT THE CISCE WILL CONSIDER THE PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN THE PAST SIX YEARS IN AWARDING MARKS AND GRADES FOR CLASS 12. THE ENTIRE MECHANISM APPEARS TO FAVOUR CONSISTENT PERFORMERS RATHER THAN THOSE WHO DISPLAY A SURPRISE SPARKLE IN THE BOARD EXAMS THOUGH THE POLICY ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE AVENUES FOR STUDENTS WHO CHANGED BOARDS OR ARE TAKING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE BOARDS EXPLAINED THAT JUST TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CLASS 12 RESULTS MAY NOT REFLECT THE POTENTIAL OF STUDENTS TAKING ONLINE EXAMS IN AN UNFAMILIAR SETTING. SO, USING THE CLASS 10 BOARD RESULTS WAS USEFUL AS IT WAS THE ONLY PUBLIC EXAM THE CURRENT CLASS 12 STUDENTS HAD TAKEN. THE CLASS 11 EXAMS WERE HELD IN PRE-COVID TIMES AND ON THE BASIS OF THE PRESCRIBED SENIOR SECONDARY SYLLABUS. THE SC BENCH NOTED ITS IN-PRINCIPLE ACCEPTANCE OF THE SCHEME AFTER EVERY PETITIONER CONVEYED THAT THEY HAD NO GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE EVALUATION MECHANISM. THE BENCH WARDED OFF SENIOR ADVOCATE 'S PLEA FOR CONDUCTING A PHYSICAL BOARD EXAMINATION FOR CLASS 12 STUDENTS AND ASKED THE TWO BOARDS TO FINALISE THE SCHEME AND NOTIFY IT AFTER INCORPORATING A GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL MECHANISM FOR STUDENTS AFTER DECLARATION OF RESULTS. VENUGOPAL INFORMED THE COURT THAT THE CBSE HAS MADE A PROVISION FOR HOLDING PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR MARKS LATER WHEN THE SITUATION NORMALISES AND THAT SUCH SCORES WOULD BE FINAL FOR THOSE WHO DECIDE TO TAKE THE OPTION. HE SAID THE DATES FOR THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION WOULD BE ANNOUNCED AFTER THE DECLARATION OF RESULTS, SUBJECT TO THE PREVAILING PANDEMIC SITUATION. THE BENCH SAID, \"AFTER PERUSING THE SCHEME, PRIMA FACIE WE HAVE NO RESERVATION IN ACCEPTING THE SAME AND PERMIT THE BOARDS TO PROCEED ON THAT BASIS. HOWEVER, THE SCHEME MUST INCORPORATE A PROVISION FOR A DISPUTE RESOLUTION COMMITTEE IN CASE SOME STUDENTS HAVE GRIEVANCES AGAINST THE MARKS/GRADES AWARDED TO THEM AFTER THE FINAL RESULTS.

THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN GIVEN LIBERTY TO PREPARE THE RESULTS BY FOLLOWING THE POLICY.

THE INCREASE IN AGGREGATE FUNDS OF INDIAN CLIENTS WITH SWISS BANKS, FROM 899 MILLION SWISS FRANCS (RS 6,625 CRORE) AT THE END OF 2019, REVERSES A TWO-YEAR DECLINING TREND AND HAS TAKEN THE FIGURE TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN 13 YEARS. IT STOOD AT A RECORD HIGH OF NEARLY 6.5 BILLION SWISS FRANCS IN 2006, AFTER WHICH IT HAS BEEN MOSTLY ON A DOWNWARD PATH, EXCEPT FOR A FEW YEARS INCLUDING IN 2011, 2013 AND 2017, AS PER THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK (SNB) DATA. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CHF 2,554.7 MILLION (RS 20,706 CRORE), DESCRIBED BY THE SNB AS 'TOTAL LIABILITIES' OF SWISS BANKS OR 'AMOUNTS DUE TO' THEIR INDIAN CLIENTS AT THE END OF 2020, INCLUDED CHF 503.9 MILLION (OVER RS 4,000 CRORE) IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, CHF 383 MILLION (OVER RS 3,100 CRORE) HELD VIA OTHER BANKS, CHF 2 MILLION (RS 16.5 CRORE) THROUGH FIDUCIARIES OR TRUSTS AND THE HIGHEST COMPONENT OF CHF 1,664.8 MILLION (NEARLY RS 13,500 CRORE) AS 'OTHER AMOUNTS DUE TO CUSTOMERS' IN FORM OF BONDS, SECURITIES AND VARIOUS OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. WHILE THE FUNDS CLASSIFIED AS 'CUSTOMER ACCOUNT DEPOSITS' HAVE ACTUALLY DECLINED FROM CHF 550 MILLION AT THE END OF 2019 AND THOSE THROUGH FIDUCIARIES ALSO MORE THAN HALVED FROM CHF 7.4 MILLION, THE MONEY HELD VIA OTHER BANKS ROSE SHARPLY FROM CHF 88 MILLION IN THIS PERIOD. HOWEVER, THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN A SURGE IN 'OTHER AMOUNTS DUE TO CUSTOMERS' FROM INDIA, WHICH ROSE OVER SIX TIMES FROM CHF 253 MILLION AT 2019-END. ALL FOUR COMPONENTS HAD DECLINED DURING 2019. THESE ARE OFFICIAL FIGURES REPORTED BY BANKS TO THE SNB AND DO NOT INDICATE THE QUANTUM OF THE MUCH-DEBATED ALLEGED BLACK MONEY HELD BY INDIANS IN SWITZERLAND. THESE FIGURES ALSO DO NOT INCLUDE THE MONEY THAT INDIANS, NRIS OR OTHERS MIGHT HAVE IN SWISS BANKS IN NAMES OF THIRD-COUNTRY ENTITIES. ACCORDING TO THE SNB, ITS DATA FOR 'TOTAL LIABILITIES' OF SWISS BANKS TOWARDS INDIAN CLIENTS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL TYPES OF FUNDS OF INDIAN CUSTOMERS AT SWISS BANKS, INCLUDING DEPOSITS FROM INDIVIDUALS, BANKS AND ENTERPRISES. THIS INCLUDES DATA FOR BRANCHES OF SWISS BANKS IN INDIA, AS ALSO NON-DEPOSIT LIABILITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE 'LOCATIONAL BANKING STATISTICS' OF THE BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENT (BIS), WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN THE PAST BY INDIAN AND SWISS AUTHORITIES AS A MORE RELIABLE MEASURE FOR DEPOSITS BY INDIAN INDIVIDUALS IN SWISS BANKS, SHOW AN INCREASE OF NEARLY 39 PER CENT DURING 2020 IN SUCH FUNDS TO USD 125.9 MILLION (RS 932 CRORE). THIS FIGURE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT DEPOSITS AS WELL AS LOANS OF INDIAN NON-BANK CLIENTS OF SWISS-DOMICILED BANKS AND HAD SHOWN AN INCREASE OF 7 PER CENT IN 2019, AFTER DECLINING BY 11 PER CENT IN 2018 AND BY 44 PER CENT IN 2017. IT PEAKED AT OVER $2.3 BILLION (OVER RS 9,000 CRORE) AT THE END OF 2007. SWISS AUTHORITIES HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT ASSETS HELD BY INDIAN RESIDENTS IN SWITZERLAND CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS 'BLACK MONEY' AND THEY ACTIVELY SUPPORT INDIA IN ITS FIGHT AGAINST TAX FRAUD AND EVASION. AN AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IN TAX MATTERS BETWEEN SWITZERLAND AND INDIA HAS BEEN IN FORCE SINCE 2018. UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK, DETAILED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON ALL INDIAN RESIDENTS HAVING ACCOUNTS WITH SWISS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SINCE 2018 WAS PROVIDED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO INDIAN TAX AUTHORITIES IN SEPTEMBER 2019 AND THIS IS TO BE FOLLOWED EVERY YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THIS, SWITZERLAND HAS BEEN ACTIVELY SHARING DETAILS ABOUT ACCOUNTS OF INDIANS SUSPECTED TO HAVE INDULGED IN FINANCIAL WRONGDOINGS AFTER SUBMISSION OF PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE. SUCH EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION HAS TAKEN PLACE IN HUNDREDS OF CASES SO FAR. OVERALL, CUSTOMER DEPOSITS IN ALL SWISS BANKS ROSE IN 2020 TO NEARLY CHF 2 TRILLION, WHICH INCLUDED OVER CHF 600 BILLION OF FOREIGN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS. WHILE THE UK TOPPED THE CHARTS FOR FOREIGN CLIENTS' MONEY IN SWISS BANKS AT CHF 377 BILLION, IT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE US (CHF 152 BILLION) AT THE SECOND SPOT -- THE ONLY TWO COUNTRIES WITH 100-BILLION-PLUS CLIENT FUNDS. OTHERS IN THE TOP 10 WERE WEST INDIES, FRANCE, HONG KONG, GERMANY, SINGAPORE, LUXEMBOURG, CAYMAN ISLANDS AND BAHAMAS. INDIA WAS PLACED AT 51ST PLACE, AHEAD OF COUNTRIES LIKE NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, SWEDEN, DENMARK, HUNGARY, MAURITIUS, PAKISTAN, BANGLADESH AND SRI LANKA. AMONG BRICS NATIONS, INDIA STOOD BELOW CHINA AND RUSSIA, BUT ABOVE SOUTH AFRICA AND BRAZIL. OTHERS PLACED ABOVE INDIA INCLUDED NETHERLANDS, UAE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, ITALY, SAUDI ARABIA, ISRAEL, IRELAND, TURKEY, MEXICO, AUSTRIA, GREECE, EGYPT, CANADA, QATAR, BELGIUM, BERMUDA, KUWAIT, SOUTH KOREA, PORTUGAL, JORDAN, THAILAND, SEYCHELLES, ARGENTINA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA AND GIBRALTAR. THE COUNTRIES FOR WHICH SWISS BANKS REPORTED A DECLINE IN AMOUNTS DUE TO CLIENTS INCLUDED THE US AND UK, WHILE THE MONEY PARKED BY INDIVIDUALS AND ENTERPRISES FROM BANGLADESH ALSO DECLINED DURING 2020. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT ALMOST DOUBLED IN THE CASE OF PAKISTAN TO OVER CHF 642 MILLION. JUST LIKE INDIA, THE ISSUE OF ALLEGED BLACK MONEY IN SWISS BANKS HAS BEEN A POLITICAL HOT POTATO IN THE TWO NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES AS WELL.

THE BAD NEWS IS THAT MANY RECORDED LOWER RATIOS THAN IN 2018 OR 2017. IN FACT, WITH MOST STATES THAT HAD A LOW SRB IN PREVIOUS YEARS SHOWING AN IMPROVEMENT, THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONVERGENCE TOWARDS A MIDDLING LEVEL. ASSAM IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES WHERE AN ALREADY LOW RATIO OF 921 IN 2017 HAS FALLEN STEEPLY TO 903 TWO YEARS LATER. THE DATA IS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL REGISTRATION SYSTEM FOR 2019. THOUGH TRIBAL COMMUNITIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY HAD BETTER SEX RATIOS THAN THE REST, CHHATTISGARH, A TRIBAL STATE, HAS RECORDED THE HIGHEST FALL IN SRB, FROM 968 IN 2017 TO 931 IN 2019. IN THE SAME PERIOD, AMONG LARGER STATES, HAS RECORDED THE BIGGEST IMPROVEMENT, FROM 915 TO 953, FOLLOWED BY UTTARAKHAND, WHERE THE SRB WENT FROM 929 TO 960. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION ESTIMATES THAT THE NATURAL SEX RATIO AT BIRTH IS ABOUT 952 FEMALES TO EVERY 1,000 MALES. THERE ARE SIX STATES, INCLUDING THREE FROM THE NORTHEAST, WHERE THE SRB IS HIGHER THAN 952. ARUNACHAL PRADESH HAD THE HIGHEST RATIO OF 1,024 \u2013 THOUGH THIS WAS A STEEP FALL FROM 1,047 \u2013 FOLLOWED BY NAGALAND AND , WHICH RECORDED 1,001 AND 975 RESPECTIVELY, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM 948 AND 964 IN 2017. IN , THOUGH THE SRB WAS STILL A HIGH 960, IT HAS WORSENED FROM 965 IN 2017. SIMILARLY, IN HIMACHAL PRADESH, IT HAS BEEN STEADILY WORSENING AND IS NOW 918. PUNJAB AND CHANDIGARH, NOTORIOUS FOR SEX SELECTIVE ABORTIONS, SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AS DID , WHERE IT WENT UP FROM 930 TO 947. DATA FOR DELHI WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR 2019, THOUGH IT SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN 2017 AND 2018. CRS ANNUAL REPORTS TILL 2016 REPORTED SRB BASED ON ALL BIRTH REGISTRATIONS DURING THE YEAR. THIS TENDED TO DISTORT THE PICTURE BECAUSE OF BIRTHS THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN PREVIOUS YEARS BUT HAD BEEN RECORDED LATER. AS A RESULT, THE SRB IS NOW CALCULATED ONLY AFTER EXCLUDING BIRTHS REGISTERED MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER THE EVENT. THE RESULT OF THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN THAT THE SRB IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR STATES LIKE , JHARKHAND, OR UTTAR PRADESH SINCE THE DATA ON DELAYED REGISTRATION WAS NOT SUBMITTED BY THESE STATES. HOWEVER, A LOOK AT THE RATIO OF MALE AND FEMALE BIRTHS REGISTERED IN THESE STATES SHOWS THAT BARRING JHARKHAND, WHERE IT IS JUST 881, IT IS WELL ABOVE 900 IN THE REST. SINCE REGISTRATION OF BIRTHS AFTER MORE THAN ONE YEAR ARE LARGELY OF MALES FOR PASSPORTS, JOBS AND SO ON, EXCLUDING SUCH REGISTRATIONS IS ONLY LIKELY TO IMPROVE THE SEX RATIO. HENCE, IT SEEMS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF JHARKHAND, THE SRB IS OVER 900 FOR ALL STATES. EVEN JHARKHAND JUST MAY HAVE AN SRB OVER 900.

EXCITEMENT AROUND THE ADANI EMPIRE SPANNING PORTS, MINES AND POWER PLANTS HAD BEEN BUILDING UP OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS THE COAL MAGNATE LOOKS BEYOND THE DIRTIEST FOSSIL FUEL FOR EXPANSION, SEEKING TO DOVETAIL HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS WITH INFRASTRUCTURE PRIORITIES SET BY PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI. INVESTORS HAD SENT SOME OF THE GROUP\u2019S STOCKS SOARING MORE THAN 500% SINCE THE START OF 2020, BETTING THE FIRST-GENERATION ENTREPRENEUR\u2019S BIG PUSH INTO SECTORS SUCH AS RENEWABLE ENERGY, AIRPORTS, DATA CENTERS AND DEFENSE CONTRACTING WILL PAY OFF. EARLIER THIS MONTH, ADANI\u2019S WEALTH WAS CLOSE TO $80 BILLION. ADDING TO THE TAILWIND WAS MSCI INC\u2019S DECISION TO INCLUDE MORE ADANI STOCKS TO ITS INDIA BENCHMARK INDEX DESPITE SCANT ANALYST COVERAGE. THREE OF ADANI\u2019S LISTED COMPANIES WERE INCLUDED IN MAY, TAKING THE GROUP\u2019S TOTAL TO FIVE. THE INCLUSION ALSO LED TO MORE MANDATED BUYING BY INVESTORS THAT TRACK THE INDEXES. THE QUICK SURGE COMBINED WITH EQUITY LARGELY HELD BY OVERSEAS FUNDS WITH VERY LITTLE PUBLIC FLOAT IS A RISK FOR ADANI SHARES, BI ANALYSTS WROTE LAST WEEK. THIS WEEK\u2019S EVENTS HAVE ALSO BROUGHT THE OPACITY AROUND THE GROUP AND ITS KEY NON-FOUNDER SHAREHOLDERS INTO FOCUS. \u201cI EXPECT THE SPECULATIVE CYCLE IN ADANI GROUP COMPANY SHARES HAS PROBABLY REACHED ITS TERM,\u201d TRAVIS LUNDY, AN ANALYST AT SMARTKARMA WROTE IN A NOTE.", "imglink": ["https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-83604515,imgsize-125257,width-400,resizemode-4/83604515.jpg"], "imgcaption": [""], "tag": ["Trending News"]}
,{"headlines": ["Company sells special eggs for vaccine, strikes it rich"], "newstext": "MUMBAI: A PRODUCER HAS ISOLATED A DISEASE-CAUSING VIRUS, PROCURED SPECIALISED RAW MATERIALS AND GLASS VIALS, AND IS SET TO START PRODUCING LIFE-SAVING BOOSTERS. BUT HOW DOES IT REPLICATE THE VIRUS FOR MASS-IMMUNISATION? ENTER . VIRUSES THAT ARE USED FOR SEVERAL VACCINE PRODUCTION NEED HOST CELLS TO GROW. FERTILE CHICKEN EGGS ARE AN EFFECTIVE MEDIUM FOR VIRUS REPLICATION AND HAVE BEEN IN USE FOR OVER 70 YEARS. INDIA\u2019S LARGEST POULTRY PRODUCER \u2019S, WHICH HAS ALMOST 100% MARKET SHARE IN THE COUNTRY FOR SPECIFIC PATHOGEN-FREE (SPF) EGGS AND SUPPLIES TO AND HESTER BIOSCIENCES, HAS SEEN DEMAND GOING UP BUT NOT DUE TO COVID IMMUNISATION. \u201cAT PRESENT, SPF EGGS ARE NOT BEING USED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF COVID VACCINES. HOWEVER, RESEARCH IS GOING IN THIS DIRECTION. THE HIGH DEMAND IS DUE TO THE RISE IN THE COST OF IMPORTED EGGS AND INCREASED REQUIREMENT OF OTHER VACCINES, INCLUDING FOR POULTRY,\u201d VENKY\u2019S GM PRASANNA PEDGAONKAR TOLD TOI. OF THE 10 LAKH SPF EGGS BEING PRODUCED BY US EVERY MONTH, A SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITY IS USED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN VACCINES FOR DISEASES LIKE RABIES AND FLU (INCLUDING ),\u201d HE SAID. FOR COVID VACCINES WHICH REQUIRE VIRUS REPLICATION, ALTERNATIVES LIKE CELL CULTURE ARE BEING USED. \u201cTHE PRICE OF SPF EGGS DEPENDS ON QUANTITY & SUPPLY FREQUENCY. THE PRICE QUOTED BY US-BASED PRODUCERS IS $2-2.5 PER EGG. THE LANDING PRICE IN INDIA WILL BE HIGHER BECAUSE OF FREIGHT & DUTY. VENKY\u2019S EGGS ARE PRICED AT AROUND $1 PER EGG,\u201d PEDGAONKAR SAID. VENKY\u2019S COMPLETED SPF EGG CAPACITY EXPANSION IN OCTOBER 2020, ACCORDING TO AN EXCHANGE FILING IN MAY. THE COMPANY SAID ITS CAPACITY UTILIZATION WAS 63% IN MAY 2021, AND IT IS TARGETING 85% UTILIZATION OF THE ANNUAL CAPACITY OF 1.4-CRORE SPF EGGS IN AND REACH 90% IN FY23. FROM BEING THE FIRST ASIAN COMPANY TO MAKE EGGS FOR VACCINE PRODUCTION IN 1983, VENKY\u2019S HAS GROWN TO BECOME THE WORLD\u2019S FOURTH-LARGEST SPF EGG PRODUCER. VENKY'S FOUNDER B V RAO, KNOWN AS THE FATHER OF POULTRY FARMING IN INDIA, STARTED A POULTRY VACCINE PRODUCTION FACILITY CALLED VENTRI BIOLOGICALS IN 1979. \u201cTO AVOID DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTS, VENKY\u2019S SIGNED A TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER DEAL WITH A US COMPANY IN 1983 FOR LOCAL PRODUCTION OF SPF EGGS. SINCE 1988, INDIA HAS BEEN SELF-SUFFICIENT IN SPF EGG REQUIREMENTS,\u201d PEDGAONKAR SAID, ADDING THAT VENKY\u2019S ALSO EXPORTS SPF EGGS. VENKY\u2019S HAS VIRTUALLY NO COMPETITORS IN SPF EGG PRODUCTION IN THE COUNTRY DUE TO A COMPLEX AND LENGTHY MANUFACTURING PROCESS. \u201cTO PRODUCE AN SPF POULTRY FLOCK ONE HAS TO SELECT PURE LINES (PEDIGREE STOCK) ON THE BASIS OF CHARACTERISTICS LIKE DISEASE RESISTANCE, EGGSHELL QUALITY, FEED INTAKE, SUPERIOR PRODUCTION, AND MAXIMUM LIVABILITY. THESE FLOCKS THEN HAVE TO BE CLEANED AGAINST VERTICALLY AND LATERALLY TRANSMITTED POULTRY DISEASE AGENTS FOR THREE GENERATIONS, WHICH TAKES AT LEAST 6-7 YEARS,\u201d PEDGAONKAR SAID. DURING THEIR LIFETIME, THE BIRDS CANNOT BE VACCINATED NOR CAN THEY BE TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS. ACCORDING TO PEDGAONKAR, THE BIRDS\u2019 BLOOD SAMPLES ARE TESTED EVERY WEEK AGAINST 42 ANTIBODIES TO CONFIRM THEIR SPF STATUS. ANY FAILURE LEADS TO STARTING FROM SCRATCH. THE FLOCKS ALSO HAVE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS LIKE FILTERED AIR POSITIVE PRESSURE HOUSES, PRE-HEATED FEED, FILTERED WATER SUPPLY, AND STRICT BIOSECURITY. VENKY\u2019S REPORTED A PROFIT OF RS 78 CRORE IN THE JANUARY-MARCH 2021 QUARTER LED BY BETTER REALISATIONS IN THE SALE OF CHICKS AND BROILERS DESPITE SEEING SOME IMPACT OF BIRD FLU IN JANUARY. ITS STOCK AT RS 2,618 IS NEAR ITS 52-WEEK HIGH LEVEL AND HAS RISEN OVER 48% IN 2021. PEDGAONKAR ADDED THAT THE SPF DIVISION IS IMPORTANT FOR VENKY\u2019S NOT JUST FROM A REVENUE PERSPECTIVE BUT DUE TO ITS POTENTIAL FOR DIVERSIFICATION. \u201cWE ARE ENGAGED IN IMMUNISATION OF SPF BIRDS AGAINST HUMAN/POULTRY VIRUSES WITH REPEATED DOSES. THE ANTIBODIES PRODUCED ARE THEN TRANSFERRED TO EGG YOLKS, WHICH ARE PURIFIED & USED FOR TREATMENT, PARTICULARLY IN ROTAVIRUS INFECTION IN CHILDREN (WHICH CAUSES SEVERE DIARRHEA). STUDIES ARE ALSO GOING ON TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR THE TREATMENT OF SNAKE BITES, RABIES, TETANUS, ETC,\u201d HE SAID.", "imglink": ["https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-83622302,imgsize-415759,width-400,resizemode-4/83622302.jpg"], "imgcaption": [""], "tag": ["Trending News"]}
